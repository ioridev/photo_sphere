1 Overview
**********

Enblend overlays multiple images using the BURT-ADELSON multiresolution
spline algorithm.(1)  This technique tries to make the seams between
the input images invisible.  The basic idea is that image features
should be blended across a transition zone proportional in size to the
spatial frequency of the features.  For example, objects like trees and
windowpanes have rapid changes in color.  By blending these features in
a narrow zone, you will not be able to see the seam because the eye
already expects to see color changes at the edge of these features.
Clouds and sky are the opposite.  These features have to be blended
across a wide transition zone because any sudden change in color will
be immediately noticeable.

   Enblend expects each input file to have an alpha channel.  The alpha
channel should indicate the region of the file that has valid image
data.  Enblend compares the alpha regions in the input files to find
the areas where images overlap.  Alpha channels can be used to indicate
to Enblend that certain portions of an input image should not
contribute to the final image.

   Enblend does _not_ align images.  Use a tool such as `hugin' or
PanoTools to do this.  The TIFF files produced by these programs are
exactly what Enblend is designed to work with.  Sometimes these GUIs
allow you to select feathering for the edges of your images.  This
treatment is detrimental to Enblend.  Turn off feathering by
deselecting it or setting the feather width to zero.

   Enblend blends the images in the order they are specified on the
command line.  You should order your images according to the way that
they overlap, for example from left-to-right across the panorama.  If
you are making a multi-row panorama, we recommend blending each
horizontal row individually, and then running Enblend a last time to
blend all of the rows together vertically.

   Enblend reads all layers of multi-layer images, like, for example,
multi-directory TIFF images(2).  The input images are processed in the
order they appear on the command line.  Multi-layer images are
processed from the first layer to the last before Enblend considers the
next image on the command line.

2 Workflow
**********

Enblend is a part of a chain of tools to assemble images.  It combines
a series of pictures taken at the same location but in different
directions.

* Menu:

* Standard Workflow::           The usual, all-in-one thing
* External Mask Manipulation::  Fiddling around with the masks yourself


File: enblend.info,  Node: Standard Workflow,  Next: External Mask Manipulation,  Up: Workflow

2.1 Standard Workflow
=====================

*note Figure:photographic-workflow:: shows where Enblend and Enfuse sit
in the tool chain of the standard workflow.

Figure 2.1: Photographic workflow with Enblend and Enfuse.

Take Images
     Take _multiple_ images to form a panorama, an exposure series, a
     focus stack, etc.

     There is one exception with Enfuse when a single raw image is
     converted multiple times to get several - typically differently
     "exposed" - images.

     _Exemplary Benefits_

        * Many pictures taken from the same vantage point but showing
          different viewing directions.  - Panorama

        * Pictures of the same subject exposed with different shutter
          speeds.  - Exposure series

        * Images of the same subject focussed at differing distances.
          - Focus stack

     _Remaining Problem:_ The "overlayed" images may not fit together,
     that is the overlay regions may not match exactly.

Convert Images
     Convert the raw data
     (http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/u-raw-files.shtml)
     exploiting the full dynamic range of the camera and capitalize on
     a high-quality conversion.

Align Images
     Align the images so as to make them match as well as possible.

     Again there is one exception and this is when images naturally
     align.  For example, a series of images taken from a rock solid
     tripod with a cable release without touching the camera, or images
     taken with a shift lens, can align without further user
     intervention.

     This step submits the images to affine transformations.  If
     necessary, it rectifies the lens' distortions (e.g. barrel or
     pincushion), too.  Sometimes even luminance or color differences
     between pairs of overlaying images are corrected ("photometric
     alignment").

     _Benefit:_ The overlay areas of images match as closely as
     possible given the quality if the input images and the lens model
     used in the transformation.

     _Remaining Problem:_ The images may still not align perfectly, for
     example, because of parallax
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax) errors, or blur produced
     by camera shake.

Combine Images
     Enblend and Enfuse combine the aligned images into one.

     _Benefit:_ The overlay areas become imperceptible for all but the
     most mal-aligned images.

     _Remaining Problem:_ Enblend and Enfuse write images with an alpha
     channel.  (For more information on alpha channels see *note
     Understanding Masks::.)  Furthermore, the final image rarely is
     rectangular.

Postprocess
     Postprocess the combined image with your favorite tool.  Often the
     user will want to crop the image and simultaneously throw away the
     alpha channel.

2.2 External Mask Manipulation
==============================

In the usual workflow Enblend and Enfuse generate the blending and
fusing masks according to the command-line options and the input images
and then they immediately use these masks for blending or fusing the
output image.

   Sometimes more control over the masks is needed or wanted.  To this
end, both applications provide the option pair `--load-masks' and
`--save-masks'.  *Note Invocation::, for detailed explanations of both
options.  With the help of these options the processing can be broken
up into two steps:

Save masks with `--save-masks'.
     Generate masks and save them into image files.

     Avoid option `--output' unless the blended or fused image at this
     point is necessary.

Load masks with `--load-masks'.
     Load masks from files and then blend or fuse the final image with
     the help of the loaded masks.

   In between these two steps the user may apply whatever transformation
to the mask files, as long as their geometries and offsets remain the
same.  Thus the "Combine Images" box of *note Figure 2.1:
Figure:photographic-workflow. becomes three activities as is depicted
in *note Figure:external-mask-workflow::.

Figure 2.2: Workflow for externally modified masks.

   To further optimize this kind of workflow, both Enblend and Enfuse
stop after mask generation if option `--save-masks' is given, but _no
output file_ is specified with the `--output' option.  This way the
time for pyramid generation, blending, fusing, and writing the final
image to disk is saved, as well as no output image gets generated.

   Note that options `--save-masks' and `--load-masks' cannot be used
simultaneously.

3 Invocation
************

`enblend' [OPTIONS] [`--output='IMAGE] INPUT...

Assemble the sequence of images INPUT... into a single IMAGE.

   Input images are either specified literally or via so-called response
files (see below).  The latter are an alternative to specifying image
filenames on the command line.

* Menu:

* Image Requirements::          Input image requirements
* Response Files::              Files listing the images' names
* Common Options::              General options
* Extended Options::            Memory and GPU control
* Mask Generation Options::     Mask generation control


File: enblend.info,  Node: Image Requirements,  Next: Response Files,  Up: Invocation

3.1 Image Requirements
======================

All input images must comply with the following requirements.

   * Parts of the images overlap.

   * Each image has an alpha channel also called "mask".

   * The images agree on their number of channels:
        - one plus alpha or

        - three plus alpha.

     This is, either all images are black-and-white (one channel and
     alpha channel) or all are RGB-color images (three channels and
     alpha channel).

   * The images agree on their number of bits-per-channel, this is,
     their "depth":
        - `UINT8',

        - `UINT16',

        - `FLOAT',

        - etc.

     See option `--depth' below for an explanation of different
     (output) depths.

   * Enblend understands the images' filename extensions as well as
     their file formats.

     You can check the supported extensions and formats by calling
     Enblend with the option pair `--version --verbose' and scan the
     output for `Supported image formats' or `Supported file
     extensions'.

   Moreover, there are some "good practices", which are not enforced by
the application, but almost certainly deliver superior results.

   * Either all files lack an ICC profile, or all images are supplied
     with the _same_ ICC profile.

   * If the images' meta-data contains resolution information ("DPI"),
     it is the same for all pictures.


File: enblend.info,  Node: Response Files,  Next: Common Options,  Prev: Image Requirements,  Up: Invocation

3.2 Response Files
==================

A response file contains names of images or other response filenames.
Introduce response file names with an at-character (`@').

   Enblend and Enfuse process the list INPUT strictly from left to
right, expanding response files in depth-first order.  (Multi-layer
files are processed from first layer to the last.) The following
examples only show Enblend, but Enfuse works exactly the same.

Solely image filenames.
     Example:
          enblend image-1.tif image-2.tif image-3.tif

     The ultimate order in which the images are processed is:
     `image-1.tif', `image-2.tif', `image-3.tif'.

Single response file.
     Example:
          enblend @list
     where file `list' contains
          img1.exr
          img2.exr
          img3.exr
          img4.exr

     Ultimate order: `img1.exr', `img2.exr', `img3.exr', `img4.exr'.

Mixed literal names and response files.
     Example:
          enblend @master.list image-09.png image-10.png
     where file `master.list' comprises of
          image-01.png
          @first.list
          image-04.png
          @second.list
          image-08.png
     `first.list' is
          image-02.png
          image-03.png
     and `second.list' contains
          image-05.png
          image-06.png
          image-07.png

     Ultimate order: `image-01.png', `image-02.png', `image-03.png',
     `image-04.png', `image-05.png', `image-06.png', `image-07.png',
     `image-08.png', `image-09.png', `image-10.png',

3.2.1 Response File Format
--------------------------

Response files contain one filename per line.  Blank lines or lines
beginning with a sharp sign (`#') are ignored; the latter can serve as
comments.  Filenames that begin with an at-character (`@') denote other
response files.  *note Table:response-file-format:: states a formal
grammar of response files in EBNF (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebnf).

RESPONSE-FILE   ::=   LINE*
LINE            ::=   (COMMENT | FILE-SPEC) [`\r'] `\n'
COMMENT         ::=   SPACE* `#' TEXT
FILE-SPEC       ::=   SPACE* `@' FILENAME SPACE*
SPACE           ::=   ` ' | `\t'

where TEXT is an arbitrary string and FILENAME is any filename.

Table 3.1: EBNF definition of the grammar of response files.

   In a response file relative filenames are used relative the response
file itself, not relative to the current-working directory of the
application.

The above grammar might unpleasantly surprise the user in the some ways.

Whitespace trimmed at both line ends
     For convenience, whitespace at the beginning and at the end of each
     line is ignored.  However, this implies that response files cannot
     represent filenames that start or end with whitespace, as there is
     no quoting syntax.  Filenames with embedded whitespace cause no
     problems, though.

Only whole-line comments
     Comments in response files always occupy a complete line.  There
     are no "line-ending comments".  Thus, in
          # exposure series
          img-0.33ev.tif # "middle" EV
          img-1.33ev.tif
          img+0.67ev.tif
     only the first line contains a comment, whereas the second line
     includes none.  Rather, it refers to a file called
     `img-0.33ev.tif # "middle" EV'.

Image filenames cannot start with `@'
     An at-sign invariably introduces a response file, even if the
     filename's extension hints towards an image.

   If Enblend or Enfuse do not recognize a response file, they will skip
the file and issue a warning.  To force a file being recognized as a
response file add one of the following syntactic comments to the
_first_ line of the file.

     response-file: true
     enblend-response-file: true
     enfuse-response-file: true

Finally, here is an example of a valid response file.
     # 4\pi panorama!

     # These pictures were taken with the panorama head.
     @round-shots.list

     # Freehand sky shot.
     zenith.tif

     # "Legs, will you go away?" images.
     nadir-2.tif
     nadir-5.tif
     nadir.tif

3.2.2 Syntactic Comments
------------------------

Comments that follow the format described in *note
Table:response-file-syntactic-comment:: are treated as instructions how
to interpret the rest of the response file.  A syntactic comment is
effective immediately and its effect persists to the end of the
response file, unless another syntactic comment undoes it.

SYNTACTIC-COMMENT   ::=   SPACE* `#' SPACE* KEY SPACE* `:' SPACE*
                          VALUE
KEY                 ::=   (`A' .. `Z' | `a' .. `z' | `-')+

where VALUE is an arbitrary string.

Table 3.2: EBNF definition of the grammar of syntactic comments in
response files.

   Unknown syntactic comments are silently ignored.

3.2.3 Globbing Algorithms
-------------------------

The three equivalent syntactic keys

   * `glob',

   * `globbing', or

   * `filename-globbing'

   control the algorithm that Enblend or Enfuse use to glob filenames in
response files.

   All versions of Enblend and Enfuse support at least two algorithms:
`literal', which is the default, and `wildcard'.  See *note
Table:globbing-algorithms:: for a list of all possible globbing
algorithms.  To find out about the algorithms in your version of
Enblend or Enfuse team up the options `--version' and `--verbose'.

`literal'
     Do not glob.  Interpret all filenames in response files as
     literals.  This is the default.

     Please keep in mind that whitespace at both ends of a line in a
     response file _always_ gets discarded.

`wildcard'
     Glob using the wildcard characters `?', `*', `[', and `]'.

     The W*N32 implementation only globs the filename part of a path,
     whereas all other implementations perform wildcard expansion in
     _all_ path components.  Also see glob(7)
     (http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man7/glob.7.html).

`none'
     Alias for `literal'.

`shell'
     The `shell' globbing algorithm works as `literal' does.  In
     addition, it interprets the wildcard characters `{', `}', and `~'.
     This makes the expansion process behave more like common UN*X
     shells.

`sh'
     Alias for `shell'.

Table 3.3: Globbing algorithms for the use in response files

   Example:
     # Horizontal panorama
     # 15 images

     # filename-globbing: wildcard

     image_000[0-9].tif
     image_001[0-4].tif

3.2.4 Default Layer Selection
-----------------------------

The key `layer-selector' provides the same functionality as does the
command-line option `--layer-selector', but on a per response-file
basis.  *Note Common Options::.

   This syntactic comment affects the layer selection of all images
listed after it including those in included response files until
another `layer-selector' overrides it.


File: enblend.info,  Node: Common Options,  Next: Extended Options,  Prev: Response Files,  Up: Invocation

3.3 Common Options
==================

Common options control some overall features of Enblend.

   Enblend accepts arguments to any option in uppercase as well as in
lowercase letters.  For example, `deflate', `Deflate' and `DEFLATE' as
arguments to the `--compression' option described below, all instruct
Enblend to use the DEFLATE compression scheme.  This manual denotes all
arguments in lowercase for consistency.

`-a'
     Pre-assemble non-overlapping images before each blending iteration.

     This overrides the default behavior which is to blend the images
     sequentially in the order given on the command line.  Enblend will
     use fewer blending iterations, but it will do more work in each
     iteration.

`--compression=COMPRESSION'
     Write a compressed output file.

     Depending on the output file format, Enblend accepts different
     values for COMPRESSION.

    JPEG format.
          The compression either is a literal integer or a
          keyword-option combination.

         `LEVEL'
               Set JPEG quality LEVEL, where LEVEL is an integer that
               ranges from 0-100.

         `jpeg[:LEVEL]'
               Same as above; without the optional argument just switch
               on (standard) JPEG compression.

         `jpeg-arith[:LEVEL]'
               Switch on arithmetic JPEG compression.  With optional
               argument set the arithmetic compression LEVEL, where
               LEVEL is an integer that ranges from 0-100.

    TIF format.
          Here, COMPRESSION is one of the keywords:

         `none'
               Do not compress.  This is the default.

         `deflate'
               Use the DEFLATE compression scheme also called
               ZIP-in-TIFF.  DEFLATE is a lossless data compression
               algorithm that uses a combination of the LZ77 algorithm
               and HUFFMAN coding.

         `jpeg[:LEVEL]'
               Use JPEG compression.  With optional argument set the
               compression LEVEL, where LEVEL is an integer that ranges
               from 0-100.

         `lzw'
               Use LEMPEL-ZIV-WELCH (LZW) adaptive compression scheme.
               LZW compression is lossless.

         `packbits'
               Use PACKBITS compression scheme.  PACKBITS is a
               particular variant of run-length compression; it is
               lossless.

    Any other format.
          Other formats do not accept a COMPRESSION setting.

          However, VIGRA (http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/)
          automatically compresses `png'-files with the DEFLATE method.

`--layer-selector=ALGORITHM'
     Override the standard layer selector algorithm, which is
     `all-layers'.

     This version of Enblend offers the following algorithms:
    `all-layers'
          Select all layers in all images.

    `first-layer'
          Select only first layer in each multi-layer image.  For
          single-layer images this is the same as `all-layers'.

    `largest-layer'
          Select largest layer in each multi-layer image, where the
          "largeness", this is the size is defined by the product of
          the layer width and its height.  The channel width of the
          layer is ignored.  For single-layer images this is the same
          as `all-layers'.

    `no-layer'
          Do not select any layer in any image.

          This algorithm is useful to temporarily exclude some images in
          response files.

`-h'
`--help'
     Print information on the available options and exit.

`-l LEVELS'
`--levels=LEVELS'
     Use at most this many LEVELS for pyramid (1) blending if LEVELS is
     positive, or reduce the maximum number of levels used by -LEVELS
     if LEVELS is negative; `auto' or `automatic' restore the default,
     which is to use the maximum possible number of levels for each
     overlapping region.

     The number of levels used in a pyramid controls the balance between
     local and global image features (contrast, saturation, ...) in the
     blended region.  Fewer levels emphasize local features and suppress
     global ones.  The more levels a pyramid has, the more global
     features will be taken into account.

     As a guideline, remember that each new level works on a linear
     scale twice as large as the previous one.  So, the zeroth layer,
     the original image, obviously defines the image at single-pixel
     scale, the first level works at two-pixel scale, and generally,
     the n-th level contains image data at 2^n -pixel scale.  This is
     the reason why an image of widthxheight pixels cannot be
     deconstructed into a pyramid of more than
          floor(log_2(min(width, height)))
     levels.

     If too few levels are used, "halos" around regions of strong local
     feature variation can show up.  On the other hand, if too many
     levels are used, the image might contain too much global features.
     Usually, the latter is not a problem, but is highly desired.  This
     is the reason, why the default is to use as many levels as is
     possible given the size of the overlap regions.  Enblend may still
     use a smaller number of levels if the geometry of the overlap
     region demands.

     Positive values of LEVELS limit the maximum number of pyramid
     levels.  Depending on the size and geometry of the overlap regions
     this may or may not influence any pyramid.  Negative values of
     LEVELS reduce the number of pyramid levels below the maximum no
     matter what the actual maximum is and thus always influence all
     pyramids.  Use `auto' or `automatic' as LEVELS to restore the
     automatic calculation of the maximum number of levels.

     The valid range of the absolute value of LEVELS is
     1 to 29.

`-o'
`--output=FILE'
     Place output in FILE.

     If `--output' is not specified, the default is to put the
     resulting image in `a.tif'.

`--parameter=KEY[=VALUE]:...'
     Set a KEY-VALUE pair, where VALUE is optional.  This option is
     cumulative.  Separate multiple pairs with the usual numeric
     delimiters.

     This option has the negated form `--no-parameter', which takes one
     or more KEYs and removes them from the list of defined parameters.
     The special key `*' deletes all parameters at once.

     Parameters allow the developers to change the internal workings of
     Enblend without the need to recompile.

`-v'
`--verbose[=LEVEL]'
     Without an argument, increase the verbosity of progress reporting.
     Giving more `--verbose' options will make Enblend more verbose.
     Directly set a verbosity level with a non-negative integral LEVEL.

     Each level includes all messages of the lower levels.

    Level
          Messages

    0
          only warnings and errors

    1
          reading and writing of images

    2
          mask generation, pyramid, and blending

    3
          reading of response files, color conversions

    4
          image sizes, bounding boxes and intersection sizes

    5
          detailed information on the optimizer runs (Enblend only)

    6
          estimations of required memory in selected processing steps

     The default verbosity level of Enblend is
     1.

`-V'
`--version'
     Output information on the Enblend version.

     Team this option with `--verbose' to show configuration details,
     like the extra features that have been compiled in.

`-w'
`--wrap=MODE'
     Blend around the boundaries of the panorama.

     As this option significantly increases memory usage and computation
     time only use it, if the panorama will be

        * consulted for any kind measurement, this is, all boundaries
          must match as accurately as possible, or

        * printed out and the boundaries glued together, or

        * fed into a virtual reality (VR) generator, which creates a
          seamless environment.

     Otherwise, always avoid this option!

     With this option Enblend treats the panorama of width w and
     height h as an infinite data structure, where each pixel P(x, y)
     of the input images represents the set of pixels S_P(x, y) (2).

     MODE takes the following values:

    `none'
    `open'
          This is a "no-op"; it has the same effect as not giving
          `--wrap' at all.  The set of input images is considered open
          at its boundaries.

    `horizontal'
          Wrap around horizontally:
               S_P(x, y) = {P(x + m * w, y): m in Z}.

          This is useful for 360o horizontal panoramas as it eliminates
          the left and right borders.

    `vertical'
          Wrap around vertically:
               S_P(x, y) = {P(x, y + n * h): m in Z}.
          This is useful for 360o vertical panoramas as it eliminates
          the top and bottom borders.

    `both'
    `horizontal+vertical'
    `vertical+horizontal'
          Wrap around both horizontally and vertically:
               S_P(x, y) = {P(x + m * w, y + n * h): m, n in Z}.

          In this mode, both left and right borders, as well as top and
          bottom borders, are eliminated.

     Specifying `--wrap' without MODE selects horizontal wrapping.

`-x'
     Checkpoint partial results to the output file after each blending
     step.

3.4 Extended Options
====================

Extended options control the image cache, the color model, and the
cropping of the output image.

`-b BLOCKSIZE'
     Set the BLOCKSIZE in kilobytes (KB) of Enblend's image cache.

     This is the amount of data that Enblend will move to and from the
     disk at one time.  The default is 2048 KB, which should be ok for
     most systems.  See *note Tuning Memory Usage:: for details.

     Note that Enblend must have been compiled with the image-cache
     feature for this option to be effective.  Find out about extra
     features with `enblend --version --verbose'.

`-c'
`--ciecam'
     Force the use of the CIECAM02 color appearance model for blending
     colors instead of blending inside the RGB color cube.

     All input files should have identical ICC profiles when this
     option is specified.  If no ICC profile is present, Enblend
     assumes that all images use the sRGB color space.  *Note Color
     Profiles::.

     Please keep in mind that using CIECAM02 blending may not only
     change the colors in the output image, but Enblend may choose
     different seam line routes as some seam-line optimizers are guided
     by image differences.

     This option can be negated; see option `--no-ciecam' below.

`-d'
`--depth=DEPTH'
     Force the number of bits per channel and the numeric format of the
     output image.

     Enblend always uses a smart way to change the channel depth to
     assure highest image quality (at the expense of memory), whether
     requantization is implicit because of the output format or explicit
     with option `--depth'.

        * If the output-channel width is larger than the input-channel
          width of the input images, the input images' channels are
          widened to the output channel width immediately after
          loading, that is, as soon as possible.  Enblend then performs
          all blending operations at the output-channel width, thereby
          preserving minute color details which can appear in the
          blending areas.

        * If the output-channel width is smaller than the input-channel
          width of the input images, the output image's channels are
          narrowed only right before it is written to disk, that is, as
          late as possible.  Thus the data benefits from the wider
          input channels for the longest time.

     All DEPTH specifications are valid in lowercase as well as
     uppercase letters.  For integer format, use

    `8', `uint8'
          Unsigned 8 bit; range: 0..255

    `int16'
          Signed 16 bit; range: -32768..32767

    `16', `uint16'
          Unsigned 16 bit; range: 0..65535

    `int32'
          Signed 32 bit; range: -2147483648..2147483647

    `32', `uint32'
          Unsigned 32 bit; range: 0..4294967295

     For floating-point format, use

    `r32', `real32', `float'
          IEEE754 single precision floating-point, 32 bit wide, 24 bit
          significant

             * Minimum normalized value: 1.2*10^-38

             * Epsilon: 1.2*10^-7

             * Maximum finite value: 3.4*10^38

    `r64', `real64', `double'
          IEEE754 double precision floating-point, 64 bit wide, 53 bit
          significant

             * Minimum normalized value: 2.2*10^-308

             * Epsilon: 2.2*10^-16

             * Maximum finite value: 1.8*10^308

     If the requested DEPTH is not supported by the output file format,
     Enblend warns and chooses the DEPTH that matches best.

     The OpenEXR data format is treated as IEEE754 float internally.
     Externally, on disk, OpenEXR data is represented by "half"
     precision floating-point numbers.

     OpenEXR (http://www.openexr.com/about.html#features) half
     precision floating-point, 16 bit wide, 10 bit significant

        * Minimum normalized value: 9.3*10^-10

        * Epsilon: 2.0*10^-3

        * Maximum finite value: 4.3*10^9

`-f WIDTHxHEIGHT'
`-f WIDTHxHEIGHT+xXOFFSET+yYOFFSET'
     Ensure that the minimum "canvas" size of the output image is at
     least WIDTHxHEIGHT.  Optionally specify the XOFFSET and YOFFSET,
     too.

     This option only is useful when the input images are cropped TIFF
     files, such as those produced by `nona'(1).

     Note that option `-f' neither rescales the output image, nor
     shrinks the canvas size below the minimum size occupied by the
     union of all input images.

`--fallback-profile=PROFILE-FILENAME'
     Use the ICC profile in PROFILE-FILENAME instead of the default
     sRGB.  See option `--ciecam' and *note Color Profiles::.

     This option only is effective if the input images come without
     color profiles and blending is performed in CIECAM02 color
     appearance model.

`-g'
     Save alpha channel as "associated".  See the TIFF documentation
     (http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/tifftags/extrasamples.html)
     for an explanation.

     Gimp (before version 2.0) and CinePaint (*note Helpful Programs::)
     exhibit unusual behavior when loading images with unassociated
     alpha channels.  Use option `-g' to work around this problem.
     With this flag Enblend will create the output image with the
     associated alpha tag set, even though the image is really
     unassociated alpha.

`--gpu'
     Use the graphics card - in fact the graphics processing unit (GPU)
     - to accelerate some computations.

     This is an experimental feature that may not work on all systems.
     In this version of Enblend, 4.2-7086b2520916, only mask
     optimization by Simulated Annealing benefits from this option.

     Note that GPU-support must have been compiled into Enblend for
     this option to be available.  Find out about this feature with
     `enblend --version --verbose'.

`-m CACHESIZE'
     Set the CACHESIZE in megabytes (MB) of Enblend's image cache.

     This is the amount of memory Enblend will use for storing image
     data before swapping to disk.  The default is
     1024 MB, which is good for systems with 3-4 gigabytes (GB) of RAM.
     See *note Tuning Memory Usage:: for details.

     Note that Enblend must have been compiled with the image-cache
     feature for this option to be effective.  Find out about extra
     features with `enblend --version --verbose'.

`--no-ciecam'
     Disable the use of the CIECAM02 color appearance model for
     blending colors.

     See option `--ciecam' for details.  Also see *note Color
     Profiles::.

File: enblend.info,  Node: Mask Generation Options,  Prev: Extended Options,  Up: Invocation

3.5 Mask Generation Options
===========================

These options control the generation and the usage of masks.

`--anneal=TAU[:DELTA-E-MAX[:DELTA-E-MIN[:K-MAX]]]'
     Set the parameters of the Simulated Annealing optimizer (see *note
     Table:optimizer-strategies::).

    TAU
          TAU is the temperature reduction factor in the Simulated
          Annealing; it also can be thought of as "cooling factor".  The
          closer TAU is to one, the more accurate the annealing run will
          be, and the longer it will take.

          Append a percent sign (`%') to specify TAU as a percentage.

          Valid range: 0 < TAU < 1.

          The default is 0.75; values around 0.95 are reasonable.
          Usually, slower cooling results in more converged points.

    DELTA-E-MAX
    DELTA-E-MIN
          DELTA-E-MAX and DELTA-E-MIN are the maximum and minimum cost
          change possible by any single annealing move.

          Valid range: 0 < DELTA-E-MIN < DELTA-E-MAX.

          In particular they determine the initial and final annealing
          temperatures according to:
                                  DELTA-E-MAX
               T_initial = -----------------------
                           log(K-MAX / (K-MAX - 2))

                               DELTA-E-MIN
               T_final = -----------------------
                         log(K-MAX^2 - K-MAX - 1)

          The defaults are: DELTA-E-MAX: 7000.0 and DELTA-E-MIN:
          5.0.

    K-MAX
          K-MAX is the maximum number of "moves" the optimizer will make
          for each line segment.  Higher values more accurately sample
          the state space, at the expense of a higher computation cost.

          Valid range: K-MAX >= 3.

          The default is 32.  Values around 100 seem reasonable.

`--coarse-mask[=FACTOR]'
     Use a scaled-down version of the input images to create the seam
     line.  This option reduces the number of computations necessary to
     compute the seam line and the amount of memory necessary to do so.
     It is the default.

     If omitted FACTOR defaults to 8, this means,
     option `--coarse-mask' shrinks the overlapping _areas_ by a factor
     of 8x8.  With FACTOR = 8 the total memory allocated during a run
     of Enblend shrinks approximately by 80% and the maximum amount of
     memory in use at a time is decreased to 60% (Enblend compiled with
     image cache) or 40% (Enblend compiled without image cache).

     Valid range: FACTOR = 1, 2, 3,....

     Also see *note Table:mask-generation::.

                   `--no-optimize'         `--optimize'
     -------------------------------------------------------------- 
     `--fine-mask' Use NFT mask.           Vectorize NFT mask,
                                           optimize vertices with
                                           simulated annealing
                                           and DIJKSTRA'S
                                           shortest path

                                           contours.

     Table 3.4: Various options that control the generation of masks.
     All mask computations are based on the Nearest-Feature
     Transformation (NFT) of the overlap region.

  `--dijkstra=RADIUS'
        Set the search RADIUS of the DIJKSTRA Shortest Path algorithm
     used in DIJKSTRA Optimization (see *note
     Table:optimizer-strategies::).

        A small value prefers straight line segments and thus shorter
     seam lines.  Larger values instruct the optimizer to let the seam
     line take more detours when searching for the best seam line.

        Valid range: RADIUS >= 1.

        Default: 25 pixels.

  `--fine-mask'
        Instruct Enblend to employ the full-size images to create the
     seam line, which can be slow.  Use this option, for example, if
     you have very narrow overlap regions.

        Also see *note Table 3.4: Table:mask-generation.

  `--image-difference=ALGORITHM[:LUMINANCE-WEIGHT[:CHROMINANCE-WEIGHT]]'
        Enblend calculates the difference of a pair of overlapping color
     images when it generates the primary seam with a Graph-Cut or
     before it optimizes a seam.  It employs a user-selectable ALGORITHM
     that itself is controlled by the weights for luminance differences
     LUMINANCE-WEIGHT, w_luminance and color differences
     CHROMINANCE-WEIGHT, w_chrominance.

        For black-and-white images the difference is simple the absolute
     difference of each pair of pixels.

    `maximum-hue-luminance'
    `maximum-hue-lum'
    `max-hue-luminance'
    `max-hue-lum'
    `max'
          Calculate the difference d as the maximum of the differences
          of the luminances l and hues h of each pair of pixels P1 and
          P2:

               d = max(w_luminance * |l(P_1) - l(P_2)|, w_chrominance * |h(P_1) - h(p_2)|)

          This algorithm was the default for Enblend up to version 4.0.

    `delta-e'
    `de'
          Calulate the difference d as the EUCLIDEAN distance of the
          pixels in L*a*b* space:
               d = sqrt(w_luminance * (L(P_1) - L(P_2))^2 +
                        w_chrominance * (a(P_1) - a(P_2))^2 +
                        w_chrominance * (b(P_1) - b(P_2))^2)

          This is the default in Enblend version 4.1 and later.

          Note that the "delta-E" mentioned here has nothing to do with
          DELTA-E-MAX and DELTA-E-MIN of option `--anneal'.

        Both LUMINANCE-WEIGHT and CHROMINANCE-WEIGHT must be
     non-negative, their sum must be positive.  Enblend automatically
     normalizes the sum of LUMINANCE-WEIGHT and CHROMINANCE-WEIGHT to
     one.  Thus `--image-difference=delta-e:2:1' and
     `--image-difference=delta-e:0.6667:0.3333' define the same
     weighting function.

        The default LUMINANCE-WEIGHT is
     1.0 and the default CHROMINANCE-WEIGHT is
     1.0.

        At higher verbosity levels Enblend computes the true size of the
     overlap area in pixels and it calculates the average and standard
     deviation of the difference per pixel in the normalized luminance
     interval [0...1].  These statistical measures are based on
     ALGORITHM, therefore they should only be compared for identical
     ALGORITHMs.  The average difference is a rough measure of quality
     with lower values meaning better matches.

  `--load-masks[=IMAGE-TEMPLATE]'
        Instead of generating masks, use those in IMAGE-TEMPLATE.  The
     default is `mask-%n.tif'.

        See `--save-masks' below for details.

  `--mask-vectorize=DISTANCE'
        Set the mask vectorization DISTANCE Enblend uses to partition
     each seam.  Thus, break down the seam to segments of length
     DISTANCE each.

        If Enblend uses a coarse mask (`--coarse-mask') or Enblend
     optimizes (`--optimize') a mask it vectorizes the initial seam
     line before performing further operations.  See *note Table 3.4:
     Table:mask-generation. for the precise conditions.  DISTANCE tells
     Enblend how long to make each of the line segments called vectors
     here.

        The unit of DISTANCE is pixels unless it is a percentage as
     explained in the next paragraph.  In fine masks one mask pixel
     corresponds to one pixel in the input image, whereas in coarse
     masks one pixel represents for example
     8 pixels in the input image.

        Append a percentage sign (`%') to DISTANCE to specify the
     segment length as a fraction of the diagonal of the rectangle
     including the overlap region.  Relative measures do not depend on
     coarse or fine masks, they are recomputed for each mask.  Values
     around 5%-10% are a good starting point.

        This option massively influences the mask generation process!
     Large DISTANCE values lead to shorter, straighter, less wiggly,
     less baroque seams that are on the other hand less optimal,
     because they run through regions of larger image mismatch instead
     of avoiding them.  Small DISTANCE values give the optimizers more
     possibilities to run the seam around high mismatch areas.

        What should _never_ happen though, are loops in the seam line.
     Counter loops with higher weights of DISTANCE-WEIGHT (in
     option `--optimizer-weights'), larger vectorization DISTANCEs, and
     TAUs (in option `--anneal') that are closer to one.  Use
     option `--visualize' to check the results.

        Valid range: DISTANCE >= 4.

        Enblend limits DISTANCE so that it never gets below
     4 even if it has been given as a percentage.  The user will be
     warned in such cases.

        Default: 4 pixels for coarse masks and
     20 pixels for fine masks.

  `--no-optimize'
        Turn off seam line optimization.  Combined with
     option `--fine-mask' this will produce the same type of mask as
     Enblend version 2.5, namely the result of a Nearest-Feature
     Transform (NFT).(1)

        Also see *note Table 3.4: Table:mask-generation.

  `--optimize'
        Use a multi-strategy approach to route the seam line around
     mismatches in the overlap region.  This is the default.  *note
     Table:optimizer-strategies:: explains these strategies; also see
     *note Table 3.4: Table:mask-generation.

     MISMATCH-WEIGHT defaults to 1.

        The seam-line optimizer considers two qualities of the seam
     line:

        * The distance of the seam line from its initial position,
          which has been determined by NFT (see option `--no-optimize').

        * The total "mismatch" accumulated along it.

        The optimizer weights DISTANCE-WEIGHT and MISMATCH-WEIGHT
     define how to weight these two criteria.  Enblend up to
     version 3.2 used 1:1.  This version of Enblend (4.2-7086b2520916)
     uses 8.0:1.0.

        A large DISTANCE-WEIGHT pulls the optimized seam line closer to
     the initial postion.  A large MISMATCH-WEIGHT makes the seam line
     go on detours to find a path along which the mismatch between the
     images is small.  If the optimized seam line shows cusps or loops
     (see option `--visualize'), reduce MISMATCH-WEIGHT or increase
     DISTANCE-WEIGHT.

        Both weights must be non-negative.  They cannot be both zero at
     the same time.  Otherwise, their absolute values are not important
     as Enblend normalizes their sum.

  `--primary-seam-generator=ALGORITHM'
        Select the algorithm responsible for generating the general
     seam route.

        This is the ALGORITHM that produces an initial seam line, which
     serves as the basis for later, optional optimizations (see
     `--optimize').  Nearest Feature Transform (NFT) is the only
     algorithm up to and including Enblend version 4.0.  Version 4.1
     added a Graph-Cut (GC) algorithm, which is the default for
     version 4.2 and later.

        Valid ALGORITHM names are:

    nearest-feature-transform
    nft
          Nearest Feature Transform

    graph-cut
    gc
          Graph-Cut

        See *note Primary Seam Generators:: for details.

  `--save-masks'
  `--save-masks=IMAGE-TEMPLATE'
        Save the generated masks to IMAGE-TEMPLATE.  The default is
     `mask-%n.tif'.  Enblend saves masks as 8 bit grayscale (single
     channel) images.  For accuracy we recommend to choose a lossless
     format.

        Use this option if you wish to edit the location of the seam
     line by hand.  This will give you images of the right sizes that
     you can edit to make your changes.  Later, use
     option `--load-masks' to blend the project with your custom seam
     lines.

        Enblend will stop after saving all masks unless
     option `--output' is given, too.  With both options given, this
     is, `--save-masks' and `--output', Enblend saves all masks and
     then proceeds to blend the output image.

        IMAGE-TEMPLATE defines a template that is expanded for each
     input file.  In a template a percent sign (`%') introduces a
     variable part.  All other characters are copied literally.
     Lowercase letters refer to the name of the respective input file,
     whereas uppercase ones refer to the name of the output file (*note
     Common Options::).  *note Table:mask-template-characters:: lists
     all variables.

        A fancy mask filename template could look like this:

          %D/mask-%02n-%f.tif

        It puts the mask files into the same directory as the output
     file (`%D'), generates a two-digit index (`%02n') to keep the mask
     files nicely sorted, and decorates the mask filename with the name
     of the associated input file (`%f') for easy recognition.

  `--visualize[=VISUALIZE-TEMPLATE]'
        Create an image according to VISUALIZE-TEMPLATE that visualizes
     the unoptimized mask and the applied optimizations (if any).  The
     default is `vis-%n.tif'.

        The image shows Enblend's view of the overlap region and how it
     decided to route the seam line.  If you are experiencing artifacts
     or unexpected output, it may be useful to include this
     visualization image in your bug report.  *Note Bug Reports::.

        VISUALIZE-TEMPLATE defines a template that is expanded for each
     input file.  In a template, a percent sign (`%') introduces a
     variable part; all other characters are copied literally.
     Lowercase letters refer to the name of the respective input file,
     whereas uppercase ones refer to the name of the output file (*note
     Common Options::).  *note Table:mask-template-characters:: lists
     all variables.

     *Visualization Image.* The visualization image shows the symmetric
     difference of the pixels in the rectangular region where two
     images overlap.  The larger the difference the lighter shade of
     gray it appears in the visualization image.  Enblend paints the
     non-overlapping parts of the image pair - these are the regions
     where _no_ blending occurs - in
     dark red.  *note Table:visualization-colors:: shows the meanings
     of all the colors that are used in seam-line visualization images.

    dark red

          light orange diamond to denote an endpoint that the optimizer
          is allowed to move around.

`%%'
     Produces a literal `%'-sign.

`%i'
     Expands to the index of the mask file starting at zero.

     `%i' supports setting a pad character or a width specification:

          `%' PAD WIDTH `i'

     PAD is either `0' or any punctuation character; the default pad
     character is `0'.  WIDTH is an integer specifying the minimum
     width of the number.  The default is the smallest width given the
     number of input images, this is 1 for 2-9 images, 2 for 10-99
     images, 3 for 100-999 images, and so on.

     Examples: `%i', `%02i', or `%_4i'.

`%n'
     Expands to the number of the mask file starting at one.  Otherwise
     it behaves identically to `%i', including pad character and width
     specification.

`%p'
     This is the full name (path, filename, and extension) of the input
     file associated with the mask.

     Example: If the input file is called `/home/luser/snap/img.jpg',
     `%p' expands to `/home/luser/snap/img.jpg', or shorter: `%p' =>
     `/home/luser/snap/img.jpg'.

`%P'
     This is the full name of the output file.

`%d'
     Is replaced with the directory part of the associated input file.
     *note Stripping a non-directory suffix from a file name:
     (coreutils.info)dirname invocation.

     Example (cont.): `%d' => `/home/luser/snap'.

`%D'
     Is replaced with the directory part of the output file.

`%b'
     Is replaced with the non-directory part (often called "basename")
     of the associated input file.  *note Stripping a directory and
     suffix from a file name: (coreutils.info)basename invocation.

     Example (cont.): `%b' => `img.jpg'.

`%B'
     Is replaced with the non-directory part of the output file.

`%f'
     Is replaced with the filename without path and extension of the
     associated input file.

     Example (cont.): `%f' => `img'.

`%F'
     Is replaced with the filename without path and extension of the
     output file.

`%e'
     Is replaced with the extension (including the leading dot) of the
     associated input file.

     Example (cont.): `%e' => `.jpg'.

`%E'
     Is replaced with the extension of the output file.

4 Primary Seam Generators
*************************

This version (4.2-7086b2520916) of Enblend supports two main algorithms
to generate seam lines.  Use option `--primary-seam-generator' to
select one of the generators.

Nearest Feature Transform (NFT)
     The NFT, also known as Distance Transform
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_transform), is a fast and
     efficient technique to produce a seam line route given the
     geometries of multiple overlapping images.

     NFT as implemented in this version of Enblend only takes into
     account the _shape of the overlap area._  It completely ignore the
     images' contents.

Graph-Cut (GC)
     GC (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_cuts_in_computer_vision) is
     a region-oriented way of segmenting images.

     The generator is based on the idea of finding a minimum cost "cut"
     of a graph created from a given image pair.  A "cut" is where the
     seam line appears.  GC determines the cost from the overlapping
     images' contents.

   The most significant difference between the two algorithms is the
output mask gradation.  NFT produces a coarse approximation of the
seam, running as far away from the overlap-region borders as possible.
The resulting mask could then be blended as-is, however, Enblend by
default runs image-content dependent optimizers to increase the mask
gradation and for example omits the regions where the images differ.
The result is a finer seam line, which only loosely follows the shape
of NFT's primary seam.

   Graph-Cut, on the other hand, is capable of producing the final mask
in one pass without the need of further optimizers.  It looks for a
seam line that is _globally_ optimal, taking into account

   * feature frequency, as well as

   * image dissimilarity.

This means, the seam is less likely to cross lines like for example
fences, lampposts, or road markings, where they would be visible.

   The optimizers which run after NFT can also be run after GC.
Nevertheless, GC works best just with a fine mask
(option `--fine-mask'); optimizers are then automatically _turned off_
to take full advantage of the detailed seam GC produces.

   GC requires more memory and computation time to complete than NFT.
Thus, it is best to prefer NFT where the images used are large and
execution time is crucial.  If quality is the priority, using GC and
fine mask usually produces visually more pleasing results.

   GC is currently limited to seams that begin and end on the images'
borders.  This means that the algorithm cannot run in cases where, for
example, one image is contained in another, resulting in a loop-like
seam.  In such cases, though, Enblend automatically falls back to a
NFT-generated seam, making its application transparent to the user.

5 Color Profiles
****************

Enblend and Enfuse expect that either

  1. no input image has a color profile or

  2. all come with the _same_ ICC
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile) profile.

In case 1 the applications blend or fuse in the RGB-cube, whereas in
case 2 the images first are transformed to CIECAM02
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02) color space - respecting the
input color profile - then they are blended or fused, and finally the
data transformed back to RGB color space.  Moreover, in case 2, Enblend
and Enfuse assign the input color profile to the output image.

   Mixing different ICC profiles or alternating between images with
profiles and without them generates warnings as it generally leads to
unpredictable results.

   The options `--ciecam' (*note Extended Options::) and its opposite
`--no-ciecam' (*note Extended Options::) overrule the default profile
selection procedure described above.  Use option `--ciecam' on a set of
input images _without_ color profiles to assign a profile to them and
perform the blending or fusing process in CIECAM02 color space.

   The default profile is sRGB (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB).
Override this setting with option `--fallback-profile' (*note Extended
Options::).

   On the other hand, suppress the utilization of CIECAM02 blending or
fusing of a set of input images _with_ color profiles with
option `--no-ciecam'.  The only reason for the latter is to shorten the
blending- or fusing-time, because transforming to and back from the
CIECAM02 color space are computationally expensive operations.

   Option `--ciecam' as well as `--fallback-profile' have no effect on
images with attached color profiles, just as option `--no-ciecam' has
no effect on images without profiles.

   The impact of blending in CIECAM02 color space as opposed to the RGB
cube vary with the contents of the input images.  Generally colors
lying close together in RGB space experience less change when switching
the blending spaces.  However, colors close the border of any color
space can see marked changes.

   For color geeks: The transformations to CIECAM02 color space and
back use

   * perceptual rendering intent,

   * the D50 white point,

   * 500 lumen surrounding light ("average" in CIECAM02 parlance), and

   * assume complete adaption.

6 Understanding Masks
*********************

A "binary mask" indicates for every pixel of an image if this pixel
must be considered in further processing, or ignored.  For a "weight
mask", the value of the mask determines how much the pixel contributes,
zero again meaning "no contribution".

   Masks arise in two places: as part of the input files and as separate
files, showing the actual pixel weights prior to image blendung or
fusion.  We shall explore both occurrences in the next sections.

6.1 Masks in Input Files
========================

Each of the input files for Enfuse and Enblend can contain its own
mask.  Both applications interpret them as binary masks no matter how
many bits per image pixel they contain.

   Use ImageMagick's `identify' or, for TIFF files, `tiffinfo' to
inquire quickly whether a file contains a mask.  *note Helpful
Programs:: shows where to find these programs on the web.

     $ identify -format "%f %m %wx%h %r %q-bit" remapped-0000.tif
     remapped-0000.tif TIFF 800x533 DirectClassRGBMatte 8-bit
                                                  ^^^^^ mask

     $ tiffinfo remapped-0000.tif
     TIFF Directory at offset 0x1a398a (1718666)
       Subfile Type: (0 = 0x0)
       Image Width: 800 Image Length: 533
       Resolution: 150, 150 pixels/inch
       Position: 0, 0
       Bits/Sample: 8
       Sample Format: unsigned integer
       Compression Scheme: PackBits
       Photometric Interpretation: RGB color
       Extra Samples: 1<unassoc-alpha>            <<<<< mask
       Orientation: row 0 top, col 0 lhs
       Samples/Pixel: 4                           <<<<< R, G, B, and mask
       Rows/Strip: 327
       Planar Configuration: single image plane

The "Matte" part of the image class and the "Extra Samples" line tell
us that the file features a mask.  Also, many interactive image
manipulation programs show the mask as a separate channel, sometimes
called "Alpha".  There, the white (high mask value) parts of the mask
enable pixels and black (low mask value) parts suppress them.

   The multitude of terms all describing the concept of a mask is
confusing.

Mask
     A mask defines a selection of pixels.  A value of zero represents
     an unselected pixel.  The maximum value ("white") represents a
     selected pixel and the values between zero and the maximum are
     partially selected pixels.  See Gimp-Savy
     (http://gimp-savvy.com/BOOK/index.html?node42.html).

Alpha Channel
     The alpha channel stores the transpacency value for each pixel,
     typically in the range from zero to one.  A value of zero means the
     pixel is completely transparent, thus does not contribute to the
     image.  A value of one on the other hand means the pixel is
     completely opaque.

Matte
     The notion "matte" as used by ImageMagick refers to an inverted
     alpha channel, more precisely: 1 - alpha.  See ImageMagick
     (http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/channels/#trans) for further
     explanations.

   Enblend and Enfuse only consider pixels that have an associated mask
value other than zero.  If an input image does not have an alpha
channel, Enblend warns and assumes a mask of all non-zero values, that
is, it will use every pixel of the input image for fusion.

   Stitchers like `nona' add a mask to their output images.

   Sometimes it is helpful to manually modify a mask before fusion.  For
example to suppress unwanted objects (insects and cars come into mind)
that moved across the scene during the exposures.  If the masks of all
input images are black at a certain position, the output image will
have a hole in that position.

7 Tuning Memory Usage
*********************

The default configuration of Enblend and Enfuse assumes a system with
3-4 GB of RAM.

   If Enblend and Enfuse have been compiled with the "image-cache"
feature, they do not rely on the operating system's memory management,
but use their own image cache in the file system.  To find out whether
your version uses the image cache say

     enblend --verbose --version

or

     enfuse --verbose --version

Enblend and Enfuse put the file that holds the image cache either in
the directory pointed to by the environment variable `TMPDIR', or, if
the variable is not set, in directory `/tmp'.  It is prudent to ensure
write permissions and enough of free space on the volume with the cache
file.

   The size of the image cache is user configurable with the option `-m
CACHE-SIZE' (*note Extended Options::).  Furthermore, option `-b
BUFFER-SIZE' (*note Extended Options::) allows for fine-tuning the size
of a single buffer inside the image cache.  Note that CACHE-SIZE is
given in megabytes, whereas the unit of BUFFER-SIZE is kilobytes.

   Usually the user lets the operating system take care of the memory
management of all processes.  However, users of Enblend or Enfuse might
want to control the balance between the operating systems' Virtual
Memory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory) system and the
image cache for several reasons.

   * Paging in or out parts of a process' image runs at kernel level and
     thus can make user processes appear unresponsive or "jumpy".  The
     caching mechanism of Enblend and Enfuse of course runs as a user
     process, which is why it has less detrimental effects on the
     system's overall responsiveness.

   * The image cache has been optimized for accesses to image data.  All
     algorithms in Enblend and Enfuse have been carefully arranged to
     play nice with the image cache.  An operating system's cache has no
     knowledge of these particular memory access patterns.

   * The disk access of the operating system to the swap device has been
     highly optimized.  Enblend and Enfuse on the other hand use the
     standard IO-layer, which is a much slower interface.

   * Limiting the amount of image cache prevents Enblend and Enfuse from
     eating up most or all RAM, thereby forcing all user applications
     into the swap.

The CACHE-SIZE should be set in such a way as to reconcile all of the
above aspects even for the biggest data sets, that is, projects with
many large images.

   *note Table:cache-size-settings:: suggests some cache- and
buffer-sizes for different amounts of available RAM.

      RAM  | CACHE-SIZE | BUFFER-SIZE | Comment
      MB   |     MB     |     KB      |
     ------+------------+-------------+---------
      4096 | 1024       | 2048        | default
      2048 | 512--1024  | 1024        |
      1024 | 256--512   | 256--512    |

Table 7.1: Suggested cache-size settings

   On systems with considerably more than 4 GB of RAM it is recommended
to run Enblend or Enfuse versions without image cache.

8 Helpful Additional Programs
*****************************

Several programs and libraries have proven helpful when working with
Enfuse and Enblend.

*Raw Image Conversion*
        * DCRaw (http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/) is a
          universal raw-converter written by DAVID COFFIN.

        * UFRaw (http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/), a raw converter written
          by UDI FUCHS and based on DCRaw, adds a GUI (`ufraw'),
          versatile batch processing (`ufraw-batch'), and some
          additional features such as cropping, noise reduction with
          wavelets, and automatic lens error correction.

*Image Alignment and Rendering*
        * ALE (http://auricle.dyndns.org/ALE/), DAVID HILVERT'S
          anti-lamenessing engine for the real die-hard command-line
          users aligns, filters, and renders images.

        * Hugin (http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) is a GUI that aligns
          and stitches images.

          It comes with several command line tools, like `nona' to
          stitch panorama images, `align_image_stack' to align
          overlapping images for HDR or create focus stacks, and
          `fulla' to correct lens errors.

        * PanoTools (http://panotools.sourceforge.net/) the successor of
          HELMUT DERSCH'S original PanoTools
          (http://www.all-in-one.ee/~dersch/) offers a set of
          command-line driven applications to create panoramas.  Most
          notable are `PTOptimizer' and `PTmender'.

*Image Manipulation*
        * CinePaint (http://www.cinepaint.org/) is a branch of an early
          Gimp forked off at version 1.0.4.  It sports much less
          features than the current Gimp, but offers 8 bit, 16 bit and
          32 bit color channels, HDR (for example floating-point TIFF,
          and OpenEXR), and a tightly integrated color management
          system.

        * The Gimp (http://www.gimp.org/) is a general purpose image
          manipulation program.  At the time of this writing it is
          still limited to images with only 8 bits per channel.

        * ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/) and its clone
          GraphicsMagick (http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) are general
          purpose command-line driven image manipulation programs, for
          example, `convert', `display', `identify', and `montage'.

*High Dynamic Range*
        * OpenEXR (http://www.openexr.com/) offers libraries and some
          programs to work with the EXR HDR format.

        * PFSTools (http://pfstools.sourceforge.net/) create, modify,
          and tonemap high-dynamic range images.

*Libraries*
        * LibJPEG (http://www.ijg.org/) is a library for handling the
          JPEG (JFIF) image format.

        * LibPNG (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) is a
          library that handles the Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
          image format.

        * LibTIFF (http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/) offers a
          library and utility programs to manipulate the ubiquitous
          Tagged Image File Format, TIFF.

          The nifty `tiffinfo' command quickly inquires the properties
          of TIFF files.

*Meta-Data Handling*
        * EXIFTool (http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
          reads and writes EXIF meta data.  In particular it copies
          meta data from one image to another.

        * LittleCMS (http://www.littlecms.com/) is the color management
          library used by Hugin, DCRaw, UFRaw, Enblend, and Enfuse.  It
          supplies some binaries, too.  `tifficc', an ICC color profile
          applier, is of particular interest.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that makes it possible to fix the bug.

A.1 Have You Really Found a Bug?
================================

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If Enblend or Enfuse get a fatal signal, for any options or input
     images, that is a bug.

   * If Enblend or Enfuse produce incorrect results, for any input
     whatever, that is a bug.

   * If Enblend or Enfuse produce an error message for valid input,
     that is a bug.

   * If Enblend or Enfuse do not produce an error message for invalid
     input, that is a bug.

A.2 How to Report Bugs
======================

The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this: report
all the facts.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or leave it
out, state it.  Often people omit facts because they think they know
what causes the problem and they conclude that some details do not
matter.  Play it safe and give a specific, complete example.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known.  Always write your bug reports on the
assumption that the bug is not known.

   Try to make your bug report self-contained.  If we have to ask you
for more information, it is best if you include all the previous
information in your response, as well as the information that was
missing.

To enable someone to investigate the bug, you should include all these
things:

   * The exact version and configuration of Enblend or Enfuse.  You can
     get this by running it with the options `--version' and
     `--verbose'.

   * A complete set of input images that will reproduce the bug.  Strive
     for a minimal set of _small_(1) images.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and its version number.

   * A complete list of any modifications you have made to the source.
     Be precise about these changes.  Show a `diff' for them.

   * Details of any other deviations from the standard procedure for
     installing Enblend and Enfuse.

   * The _exact command line_ you use to call Enblend or Enfuse, which
     then triggers the bug.

     Examples:

          ~/local/bin/enblend -v \
              --fine-mask \
              --optimizer-weights=3:2 --mask-vectorize=12.5% \
              image-1.png image-2.png

     or:

          /local/bin/enfuse \
              --verbose \
              --exposure-weight=0 --saturation-weight=0 --entropy-weight=1 \
              --gray-projector=l-star \
              --entropy-cutoff=1.667% \
              layer-01.ppm layer-02.ppm layer-03.ppm

     If you call Enblend or Enfuse from within a GUI like, for example,
     Hugin (http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) or KImageFuser
     (http://panorama.dyndns.org/index.php?lang=en&subject=KImageFuser&texttag=KImagefuser)
     by HARRY VAN DER WOLF, copy&paste or write down the command line
     that launches Enblend or Enfuse.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "The application gets a fatal signal," or,
     "The output image contains black holes."

     Of course, if the bug is that the application gets a fatal signal,
     then one cannot miss it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.

A.3 Sending Patches for Enblend or Enfuse
=========================================

If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for Enblend or
Enfuse, that is very helpful.  When you send your changes, please
follow these guidelines to avoid causing extra work for us in studying
the patches.  If you do not follow these guidelines, your information
might still be useful, but using it will take extra work.

   * Send an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or
     what improvement they bring about.  For a bug fix, just include a
     copy of the bug report, and explain why the change fixes the bug.

   * Always include a proper bug report for the problem you think you
     have fixed.  We need to convince ourselves that the change is
     right before installing it.  Even if it is right, we might have
     trouble judging it if we do not have a way to reproduce the
     problem.

   * Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people
     reading the source in the future understand why this change was
     needed.

   * Do not mix together changes made for different reasons.  Send them
     individually.

     If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not
     want to install them both.  We might want to install just one.

   * Use the version control system to make your diffs.  Prefer the
     unified diff (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format)
     format: `hg diff --unified 4'.

   * You can increase the probability that your patch gets applied by
     basing it on a recent revision of the sources.

Appendix C GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.
