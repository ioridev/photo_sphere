After more than two years there is finally a new release of Lensfun available. Version 0.2.6 notably comes with many new lenses and cameras but there were also several changes under the hood.

In detail:

* more than 40 new database entries of lenses and compact cameras
* new CMake based build system for better cross platform compatibility and compilation fixes for MSVC
* better integration into hugin for loading and storing lens parameters via the lensfun library
* several bug fixes and stability improvements

The source code of the release is available from BerliOS project page.

From now on there will be new releases on a regular basis to frequently bring back database enhancements to the user base. Frequently meaning at least every six months or when there is a significant amount of new profiles.
