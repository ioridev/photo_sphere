The following changes have been made to it:

-*- Renamed "makedepend" into "makedep" to conform with pity DOS file naming
    convention (8 + 3).

-*- Converted to C++ (better syntax checking and so on ...). Replaced
    "boolean" with "bool", "TRUE" -> "true" and "FALSE" -> "false".

-*- When run with no files on command line, display a short message and exit.

-*- Added the "-h" option for a short command-line help.

-*- Added the "-S" option so that "makedep" will generate dependencies
    on system include files (like before and like gcc -M). By default
    (i.e. without "-S" switch) it lists only user include files (i.e.
    those that are #include'd "...", system include files are considered
    those that are #include'd <...> this way).

-*- Modified so that by default it won't create backups of makefile. If you
    need them, run makedep with "-b" switch.

-*- Added the "-c" switch to tell "makedep" to create makefile if it does
    not exist.

-*- Added the "-r" switch to remove directory prefix from object files.

-*- Added preprocessor predefines required on Win32 platform.

-*- Added displaying of include file history on errors and warnings.
    Example:

makedep: warning:  ./include/def.h: 23: #error "You are not allowed to include this file! Use cssysdef.h instead."
makedep: warning:  included from ./include/csutil/impexp.h
makedep: warning:  included from ./include/csparser/crossbld.h
makedep: warning:  included from libs/csparser/crossbld.cpp

-*- Updated man page on all above improvements.

-*- Added a version number to distinguish between different versions of makedep.
    Although makedepend itself is pretty old, I've started from version 0.0.1
    as I don't have any idea what the version number should be :-)
    Added the "-V" switch to display the version.
